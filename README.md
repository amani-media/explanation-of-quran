# Explanations of the Quran

An effort to make the most beautiful and trusted explanations of God's final revelation to humanity, the Quran, accessible to everyone. Collaboration welcome.

# Key terms

**Tafsir:** Arabic term for "Explanation of the Quran"

**Quran:** God's final revelation to humanity

**Hadith:** Sayings and recorded tradition of the Prophet

**Surah:** Sometimes unfairly translated as "Chapter", Surah's are a collection of topics and themes that are organised uniquely in a manner very unlike chapters.

**Ayah's** Also unfairly translated as "Verses" - these are the quran's building blocks, a surah has multiple ayahs. 

# Goals

The goal of this project is to make Tafsir (explanations of the Quran):

1. Accessible
2. Structured to facilitate text search and analysis
3. Consumable

## Accessibility

Most explanations of the quran are available in PDF that isn't searchable, proprietary websties or behind paywalls. Our goal is to make Tafsir opensource and accessible to anyone and everyone. Muslim and Non Muslim.

To this end, we have a few principles to ensure accessibility. Content should be

a. Text in favour of images
b. Where images are necessary (e.g. they illustrate a concept), then it should be well annotated
c. Screen reader friendly
d. Easy to reference

## Structured

Rather than transcribing "blobs" of text. We have an opportunity to make Tafsir structured. Examples include:

a. Tagging narrators
b. Tagging verses from the Quran and Hadith
c. Having clear and easy to understand file structures
d. Traceable - this helps others verify how accurate translations into other languages are

## Consumable

Quran is timeless and will forever have undiscovered insights. So we want to ensure that both the quran and its explanations can be consumed by existing and future technologies to enable ongoing exploration and discovery.

We hope the afformentioend goals will in and of themselves make the Quran consumable, but we are open to recomendations on what principles to include here.

For now, our hoe is that the quran and its explanations can be consumed in some of the following formats:

* PDF, ePub and other readable formats
* VR, XR
* Relational, Graph and Vector Databases
* Website and API technologies
